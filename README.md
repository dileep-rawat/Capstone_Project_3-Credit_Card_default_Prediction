# Statement
The purpose of this project is to conduct quantitative analysis on credit card default risk by using machine learning models with accessible customer data, instead of credit score or credit history, with the goal of assisting and speeding up the human decision making process.

# Overview
This project aims to build a classification model that can predict whether or not a customer will default on their credit card. From the perspective of risk management, understanding the customer characteristics that lead to this outcome can aid creditors in deciding reasonable credit limits to prevent this. After cleaning the data, handling class imbalance, feature engineering and tuning hyperparameters, the final XG Boost model achieved an F1 score of 0.928.
